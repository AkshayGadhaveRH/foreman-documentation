== Headline Features

=== Plugin translation infrastructure in frontend

With this release it's possible for plugins to use translations in Javascript.
Since the front end is largely moving towards Javascript, this is a great improvement for who care about an internationalized application.
Note that having the infrastructure in place doesn't guarantee everything is translated.
