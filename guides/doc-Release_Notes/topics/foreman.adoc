== Upgrade Warnings

=== `require_ssl_smart_proxies` setting dropped

The `require_ssl_smart_proxies` setting has been dropped and Foreman now behaves as if the value was `true` (the default). This means it's no longer possible to use reverse DNS instead of client certificates over HTTPS connections. Upgrading users should ensure a valid Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) exists.

For more information see the https://community.theforeman.org/t/drop-require-ssl-and-require-ssl-smart-proxies-settings/26772[RFC] and https://github.com/theforeman/foreman/pull/9021[PR].
