= Performing post-upgrade tasks

Some of the procedures in this section are optional.
You can choose to perform only those procedures that are relevant to your installation.

If you use custom templates created from a cloned default template, create the custom template again after the upgrade.
Sometimes the default templates are changed during the upgrade, this will ensure that the custom templates are compatible with the latest version.
