= Migrating {Project} or {SmartProxy} to {EL}{nbsp}9

You can migrate your existing {Project} and {SmartProxy} installation from {EL}{nbsp}8 to a freshly installed {EL}{nbsp}9 system.

.Terminology
Ensure that you understand the following terms:

*Source server*:: The existing {EL}{nbsp}8 system on which {Project} or {SmartProxy} is installed.

*Target server*:: The new {EL}{nbsp}9 system to which {Project} or {SmartProxy} will be migrated.

.Migration process overview:
. Create a backup of the existing {Project} or {SmartProxy} on {EL}{nbsp}8.
. Deploy a new {EL}{nbsp}9 system.
