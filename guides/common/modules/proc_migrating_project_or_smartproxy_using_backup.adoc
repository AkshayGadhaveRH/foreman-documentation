.Procedure
. Perform a full backup of the {Project} or {SmartProxy}.
This is the source {EL}{nbsp}8server that you are migrating.
For more information, see {AdministeringDocURL}backing-up-satellite-server-and-capsule_admin#Performing_a_Full_Backup_admin[Performing a full backup of Satellite Server or Capsule Server] in _{AdministeringDocTitle}_.
. Deploy a {EL}{nbsp}9 system.
This is the target server.
Install {Project} or {SmartProxy} on the target {EL}{nbsp}9 system:
** To install {ProjectServer} from a connected network, see {InstallingServerDocURL}[{InstallingServerDocTitle}].
ifdef::satellite[]
** To install {ProjectServer} from a disconnected network, see {InstallingServerDisconnectedDocURL}[{InstallingServerDisconnectedDocTitle}].
endif::[]
** To install a {SmartProxyServer}, see {InstallingSmartProxyDocURL}[{InstallingSmartProxyDocTitle}].
