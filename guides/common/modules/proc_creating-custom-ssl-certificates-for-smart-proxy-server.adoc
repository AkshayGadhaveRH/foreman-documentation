= Creating custom SSL certificates for {SmartProxyServer}

This procedure outlines how to create a configuration file for the Certificate Signing Request and include the load balancer and {SmartProxyServer} as Subject Alternative Names (SAN).
Complete this procedure on each {SmartProxyServer} that you want to configure for load balancing.

.Procedure
. On {SmartProxyServer}, create a directory to contain all the source certificate files, accessible to only the `root` user:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# mkdir /root/{smart-proxy-context}_cert
# cd /root/{smart-proxy-context}_cert
----
. Create a private key with which to sign the Certificate Signing Request (CSR).
+
Note that the private key must be unencrypted.
If you use a password-protected private key, remove the private key password.
+
If you already have a private key for this {SmartProxyServer}, skip this step.
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# openssl genrsa -out /root/{smart-proxy-context}_cert/{smart-proxy-context}_cert_key.pem 4096
----
. Create the certificate request configuration file with the following content:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
[ req ]
req_extensions = v3_req
distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name
x509_extensions = usr_cert
prompt = no

[ req_distinguished_name ]
commonName = _{smartproxy-example-com}_ <1>

[ v3_req ]
basicConstraints = CA:FALSE
keyUsage = digitalSignature, nonRepudiation, keyEncipherment, dataEncipherment
extendedKeyUsage = serverAuth, clientAuth, codeSigning, emailProtection
subjectAltName = @alt_names

[alt_names] <2>
DNS.1 = _{loadbalancer-example-com}_
DNS.2 = _{smartproxy-example-com}_
----
<1> The certificate's common name must match the FQDN of {SmartProxyServer}.
Ensure to change this when running the command on each {SmartProxyServer} that you configure for load balancing.
You can also set a wildcard value `*`.
If you set a wildcard value, you must add the `-t {certs-proxy-context}` option when you use the `katello-certs-check` command.
<2> Under `[alt_names]`, include the FQDN of the load balancer as `DNS.1` and the FQDN of {SmartProxyServer} as `DNS.2`.
Optional: If you want to add Distinguished Name (DN) details to the CSR, add the following information to the `[ req_distinguished_name ]` section:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
[req_distinguished_name]
CN = _{context}.example.com_
countryName =_My_Country_Name_ <1>
stateOrProvinceName = _My_State_Or_Province_Name_ <2>
localityName = _My_Locality_Name_ <3>
organizationName = _My_Organization_Or_Company_Name_
organizationalUnitName = _My_Organizational_Unit_Name_ <4>
----
<1> Two letter code
<2> Full name
<3> Full name (example: New York)
<4> Division responsible for the certificate (example: IT department)
. Create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) for the SAN certificate:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# openssl req -new \
-key /root/{smart-proxy-context}_cert/{smart-proxy-context}_cert_key.pem \ <1>
-config SAN_config.cfg \ <2>
-out /root/{smart-proxy-context}_cert/{smart-proxy-context}_cert_csr.pem <3>
----
<1> {SmartProxyServer}’s private key, used to sign the certificate
<2> The certificate request configuration file
<3> Certificate Signing Request file

. Send the certificate request to the Certificate Authority:
+
When you submit the request, specify the lifespan of the certificate.
The method for sending the certificate request varies, so consult the Certificate Authority for the preferred method.
In response to the request, you can expect to receive a Certificate Authority bundle and a signed certificate, in separate files.
. Copy the Certificate Authority bundle and {SmartProxyServer} certificate file that you receive from the Certificate Authority, and {SmartProxyServer} private key to your {ProjectServer}.
. On {ProjectServer}, validate {SmartProxyServer} certificate input files:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# katello-certs-check \
-c /root/{smart-proxy-context}_cert/{smart-proxy-context}_cert.pem \ <1>
-k /root/{smart-proxy-context}_cert/{smart-proxy-context}_cert_key.pem \ <2>
-b /root/{smart-proxy-context}_cert/ca_cert_bundle.pem <3>
----
<1> {SmartProxyServer} certificate file, provided by your Certificate Authority
<2> {SmartProxyServer}’s private key that you used to sign the certificate
<3> Certificate Authority bundle, provided by your Certificate Authority
+
If you set the `commonName=` to a wildcard value `*`, you must add the `-t {certs-proxy-context}` option to the `katello-certs-check` command.
+
Retain a copy of the example `{certs-generate}` command that is output by the `katello-certs-check` command for creating the Certificate Archive File for this {SmartProxyServer}.
