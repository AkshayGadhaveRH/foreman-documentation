= Managing Alternate Content Sources

Alternate content sources define alternate paths to download content during synchronization.
The content itself is downloaded from the alternate content source and only the metadata is downloaded from the upstream URL.
Alternate content source can be used to speed up synchronization if the content is located on the local filesystem or on a nearby network.
You can set up alternate content sources for {Project} and {SmartProxy}.
