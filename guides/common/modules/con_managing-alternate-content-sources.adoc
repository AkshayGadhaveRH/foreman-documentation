= Managing Alternate Content Sources

Alternate content sources define alternate paths to download content during synchronization.
The content itself is downloaded from the alternate content source and only the metadata is downloaded from the {ProjectServer}.
You can use alternate content source to speed up synchronization if the content is located on the local filesystem or on a nearby network.
You can set up alternate content sources for {ProjectServer} and {SmartProxy}.
You must refresh the alternate content source after creation or after making any changes.
A weekly cron job refreshes all alternate content sources.
You can also refresh the alternate content sources manually using the {ProjectWebUI} or the Hammer CLI.

There are three types of alternate content sources:

Custom::
Custom alternate content source downloads the content from any upstream repository or from the local filesystem.

Simplified::
Simplified alternate content source copies the upstream repo information from the {ProjectServer}.
You can use simplified alternate content sources in situations where connections to the upstream repo is faster than the {ProjectServer}.
ifdef::satellite[]
Selecting the Red Hat products when creating a simplified alternate content source will download the content to the {SmartProxies} from the Red Hat CDN.

RHUI::
RHUI alternate content source downloads content from the Red Hat Update Infrastructure server in your environment.
