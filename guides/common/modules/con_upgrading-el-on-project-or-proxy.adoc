= Upgrading {EL} on {Project} or {SmartProxy}

There are two methods to upgrade your {Project} or {SmartProxy} from {EL} 8 to {EL} 9:

* Leapp in-place upgrade
* Backup and restore

With Leapp, you can upgrade your {Project} or {SmartProxy} in place therefore it is faster but imposes a downtime on the services.
With backup, you can move your {Project} or {SmartProxy} to a fresh {EL} 9 system.
Backup requires very little downtime.
