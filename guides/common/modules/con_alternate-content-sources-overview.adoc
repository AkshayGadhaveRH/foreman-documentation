= Alternate Content Sources Overview

Alternate content sources define alternate paths to download content during synchronization.
This speeds up the repository synchronization.
The content itself is synchronized from the alternate content source, and only the metadata is downloaded from the actual repository server.
Alternate content sources can be set up for {Project}, as well as for {SmartProxy}.
