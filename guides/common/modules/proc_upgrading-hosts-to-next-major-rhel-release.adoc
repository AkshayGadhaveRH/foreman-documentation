.Procedure
. On {Project}, enable the Leapp plugin:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-installer} --enable-foreman-plugin-leapp
----
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Hosts* > *All Hosts*.
. Select the hosts that you want to upgrade to the next major {RHEL} version.
. In the upper right of the Hosts window, from the *Select Action* list, select *Preupgrade check with Leapp*.
. Click *Submit* to start the pre-upgrade check.
. When the check is finished, click the *Leapp preupgrade report* tab to see if Leapp has found any issues on the hosts.
Issues that have the *Inhibitor* flag are considered crucial and are likely to break the upgrade procedure.
Some issues might have documentation linked that describe how to fix them.
. Optional: If you have issues that have commands associated with them, you can fix them with a remote job.
To do that, select these issues, click the *Fix Selected* button, and submit the job.
. After you fixed the issues, click the *Rerun* button, and then click *Submit* to run the pre-upgrade check again to verify that the {RHEL} hosts you are upgrading do not have any issues and are ready to be upgraded.
. When your systems are ready for the upgrade, click the *Run Upgrade* button and click *Submit* to start the upgrade.
