= Upgrading {Project} or {SmartProxy} from {EL} 8 to {EL} 9

There are two methods to upgrade your {Project} or {SmartProxy} from {EL} 8 to {EL} 9:
* Using LEAPP
* Using backup

With LEAPP you can upgrade your [Project] or [SmartProxy] in place and hence it is faster, however this imposes a downtime on the services.
Using backup allows you to move your {Project} or {SmartProxy} to a fresh {EL} 9 system.
Backup requires very little downtime.
